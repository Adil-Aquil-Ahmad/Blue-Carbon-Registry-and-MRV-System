### üîç Troubleshooting:

#### If Emails Aren't Sending:
1. **Check email configuration** in `email_config.py`
2. **Verify app password** is generated correctly
3. **Check spam folder** for test emails
4. **Run test script**: `python test_email.py`
5. **Check firewall** allows outbound connections on port 587

#### Common Issues:
- **"Authentication failed"**: Wrong email/password
- **"Connection refused"**: Firewall blocking or wrong SMTP server
- **"Email not received"**: Check spam folder first

#### For Other Email Providers:
- **Outlook**: `smtp-mail.outlook.com:587`
- **Yahoo**: `smtp.mail.yahoo.com:587`
- **Custom SMTP**: Contact your hosting provider

### üåê Production Deployment:

#### Environment Variables (Recommended):
```bash
export SMTP_SERVER="smtp.gmail.com"
export SMTP_PORT="587"
export SENDER_EMAIL="bluecarbon.noreply@gov.in"
export SENDER_PASSWORD="your_app_password"
export FRONTEND_BASE_URL="https://your-domain.com"
```

#### Security Best Practices:
1. Use environment variables for credentials
2. Generate dedicated app passwords
3. Monitor email sending logs
4. Set up email rate limiting if needed
5. Use official government email addresses in production

### üìû Support:

If you need help setting up email functionality:
1. Run the test script: `python test_email.py`
2. Check the troubleshooting section above
3. Verify your email provider's SMTP settings
4. Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled for Gmail

The email system is designed to be robust - if email sending fails, user registration will still succeed, and an error will be logged for administrator review.

### üéâ You're All Set!

Your Blue Carbon Services Portal now automatically sends professional welcome emails to new users, enhancing the user experience and providing them with important getting-started information!
